            <h2>What is Manahyme Kyokupara?</h2>
            <p>Manahyme Kyokupara is an upcoming free-to-play (or rather, TRULY free-to-win) rhythm game you would expect; just some rehash of "insert name of rhythm game here", et cetera, but in truth more than just one of them!</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Basic gameplay will be like <a href="new.ppy.sh/wiki" target="_blank">osu!</a>, with a few modifications to its types of notes.</li>
                        <li>However, the song clear condition will use <a href="p.eagate.573.jp/game/2dx/24/p/howto/play/game_start.html" target="_blank">beatmania IIDX's Groove Guage</a> (Fill up the guage to a certain threshold by the end of the song to clear, but a single note break drops the guage by a certain amount).</li>
                        <li>The mapping style will be initially osu!-style with a sprinkle of Taiko No Tatsujin-esque note distribution.</li>
                        <li>Two scoring systems are used; the osu! scoring system (as the raw score), and beatmania IIDX's EX score system (as the rank score).</li>
                        <li>Difficulty calculation system will initally be ranged from zero (0) to twelve (12) units. Unit name is currently not finalized.</li>
                        <li>
                            Gameplay mod system will initially be comprised of:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Assistance: Easy Diff (<i>decreases overall difficulty of the song</i>), Slow Motion (<i>decreases song BPM to 0.5x speed</i>), Super Slow Motion (<i>extension of Slow Motion; decreases song BPM to 0.33x speed</i>), Loose Judge (<i>increases timing window of notes</i>) and Failsafe (<i>treat falied songs as clears</i>)</li>
                                <li>Intensity: Hard Rock (<i>increases overall difficulty of the song</i>), Sudden Death (<i>break the combo and you instantly fail the song</i>), Perfection (<i>extension of Sudden Death; player must pass with 100% accuracy</i>), Sonic (<i>increases song BPM to 1.5x speed</i>), Super Sonic (<i>extension of Sonic; increases song BPM to 2x speed</i>), Fadeout (<i>notes fade out before hit</i>), Hidden (<i>extension of Fadeout; note will not appear at all</i>) and Strict Judge (<i>decrease timing window of notes</i>)</li>
                                <li>Fun: Relaxation (<i>player cursor moves automatically</i>), Automatic (<i>autoplay</i>), Cinematic (<i>view only storyboard or video</i>)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Overall User Play Progress will use an adventure-like system</li>
                        <li>Overall User Play Ranking will use a modified version of <a href="new.ppy.sh/wiki" target="_blank">osu!</a>'s PP system</li>
                        <li>Account-wide personalization system (complete with signature skin, titles, etc.)</li>
                        <li>User Hierachy System (to determine whether user is normal player, dev, mod, etc.)</li>

                        <li>Called beatmaps like osu!</li>
                        <li>Difficulties named in ascending order of intensity: <i>Novice</i>, <i>Intermediate</i>, <i>Advanced</i>, <i>Extreme</i>, <i>Master</i>, <i>Challenge</i> (latter difficulty can allow large gap unlike other difficulties)</li>
                        <li>Can be favorited or (unlike osu!) blacklisted by user</li>
                        <li>Live Genre Classification System (other users can change genres of beatmaps, not limited to beatmap creator)</li>
                        <li>Beatmap Autorization System (akin to osu!'s beatmap ranking system)</li>
                        <li>Beatmap Song Live Identification System (to keep track of the same songs that are offered)</li>
                        <li>Copyright Metadata (to ensure disclaimer of ownership of songs)</li>
                        <li>Explicit Content Marking (to identify songs that are considered offensive to some players, linked to Beatmap Song Live Identification System)</li>
